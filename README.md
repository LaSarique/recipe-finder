### About The Project
One Cookbook App was a project which I put together for the purpose of a Hackathon day at Salt. This was a simple project with the main goal of the challenge to build a functional product within one day. Beside the obvious timeframe challenge, my goal in this project was also to utilise my knowledge in React, NodeJS and ExpressJS. 

#### Features
The main features this app was to deliver on includes
- Searchbar- users are able to enter in a search and the application returns results
- Filter- through the use of dropdown selections and checkboxes, searches are filtered
- Pagination- ensuring easy navigation for large search results
